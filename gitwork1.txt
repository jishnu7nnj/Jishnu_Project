Version Control:
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It helps to manage the changes made to documents, programs, web sites etc.
Centralized Version Control:
Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place.
 
Distributed Version Control:
In a DVCS (such as Git, Mercurial), clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files; rather, they fully mirror the repository, including its full history. Thus, if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.
 
There are various version control tools:
1. git   2.Concurrent Version System(CVS)  3.Mercurial   4.Apache Subversions.
